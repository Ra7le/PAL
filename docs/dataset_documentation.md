 PAL-Dataset Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the construction, sources, and methodology behind the PAL-Dataset, a dataset containing 550 case studies demonstrating the application of the Project Approval Law (PAL) framework. The dataset is designed to be transparent, reproducible, and compliant with global standards for data transparency, such as those outlined by the Open Data Charter and FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). This documentation is intended for inclusion in a GitHub repository to ensure clarity for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners.

 1. Overview

The PAL-Dataset consists of 550 synthetic yet realistic case studies across five domains: infrastructure, environmental, social, and governance (ESG), artificial intelligence/biotechnology (AI/biotech), fintech, and public policy. Each case evaluates a project's likelihood of approval using the PAL framework, which quantifies project value (\(V(t)\)), systemic resistance (\(S(t)\)), and approval probability (\(P(t)\)) based on a set of input parameters.

The dataset is provided in CSV format (`pal_dataset.csv`) with 550 rows and 16 columns, including unique identifiers, domain, jurisdiction, input parameters, calculated metrics, outcomes, and sources. The dataset was constructed to support research into project evaluation, decision-making, and policy analysis while adhering to transparency standards.

- Fintech: 50 cases (e.g., Sarwa, Kassa24).
- Public Policy: 50 cases (e.g., Smart Nation, regulatory reforms).
- Total: 550 cases.

 3. Methodology

The dataset was constructed by combining real-world case studies with synthetic cases derived from templates and informed by open-source data. The PAL framework was applied to calculate derived metrics (`pt`, `tt`, `sd`, `out`).

# 3.1 PAL Framework
The Project Approval Law (PAL) quantifies project approval dynamics using the following equations:

\[
V(t) = \frac{w \cdot V}{\sqrt{\sum w_i^2 + C(t)^2}}, \quad S(t) = \frac{u \cdot S}{\sqrt{\sum u_i^2 + C(t)^2}},
\]

\[
V_{\text{eff}}(t) = \frac{V(t)}{1 + \alpha S(t) + C(t)}, \quad S_{\text{eff}}(t) = \frac{S(t)}{1 + \beta V(t) + C(t)},
\]

\[
F(t) = V_{\text{eff}}(t) - S_{\text{eff}}(t), \quad P(t) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-F(t)}},
\]

\[
T(t) = \frac{12 S_{\text{eff}}(t)}{V_{\text{eff}}(t)}, \quad S_{\text{deal}} = V_{\text{eff}}(t) \cdot V_{\text{market}},
\]

Where:
- \( V = [V_{\text{innov}}, V_{\text{impact}}, V_{\text{fin}}] \), \( S = [S_{\text{reg}}, S_{\text{risk}}, S_{\text{skep}}] \).
- \( w = u = [1/3, 1/3, 1/3] \) (equal weights).
- \( \alpha = 1.5 \), \( \beta = 0.5 \).
- \( C(t) \) is contextual complexity.
- \( P(t) > 0.5 \) results in `out=A`; otherwise, `out=R`.

# 3.2 Case Construction
Cases were built using a combination of real and synthetic data:

1. Real Cases:
   - Derived from documented projects (e.g., Burj Khalifa, Masdar City, Sarwa, EU AI Act).
   - Parameters (`vi`, `vp`, `vf`, `sr`, `sk`, `ss`, `ct`, `vm`) were estimated based on source data.
   - Example: Burj Khalifa (`id=BK`) has high `vi` (0.85), `vp` (0.9), and `vf` (0.95) due to its innovative design, global impact, and financial backing.

2. Synthetic Cases:
   - Generated by applying templates from real cases to different jurisdictions and domains.
   - Example: Solar farm cases (e.g., `ESG001`) were modeled after Masdar City and adjusted for jurisdictions like Australia (`jur=AUS`) with context-specific `ct` and `vm`.
   - Parameters were varied within realistic ranges (e.g., `vi` [0.6, 0.95], `sr` [0.2, 0.5]) to reflect diversity.

3. Parameter Estimation:
   - Innovation (`vi`): Based on patent filings (WIPO), technology adoption rates, and R&D intensity.
   - Impact (`vp`): Derived from ESG scores (S&P ESG), social benefit metrics, and environmental impact assessments.
   - Financial (`vf`): Estimated from ROI data (PitchBook), project budgets, and market analyses.
   - Regulatory (`sr`): Informed by World Bank governance indicators and regulatory complexity indices.
   - Risk (`sk`): Based on project risk profiles from PitchBook and World Bank.
   - Skepticism (`ss`): Estimated from public sentiment (Google News, Weibo) and cultural factors (Hofstede).
   - Context (`ct`): Derived from Hofstede cultural dimensions and GCRI jurisdictional complexity scores.
   - Market Value (`vm`): Sourced from PitchBook, World Bank, and market reports.

4.  Outcome Assignment:
   - Outcomes (`out`) were determined by `pt`: `A` if `pt > 0.5`, `R` otherwise.
   - Example: Greenwashing cases (e.g., `ESG016`) have low `vp` (0.3), high `ss` (0.5), resulting in `pt=0.42` and `out=R`.

  3.3 Quality Control
-   Consistency: All parameters were normalized to [0,1] where applicable, and calculations were verified using the PAL equations.
-   Diversity: Cases cover 20+ jurisdictions and five domains to ensure broad applicability.
-   Validation: A subset of real cases was cross-checked against source data to ensure accuracy.
-   Reproducibility: The PAL calculation script (`pal_calculator.py`) is provided to replicate `pt`, `tt`, and `sd`.

 3.4 Legal Use Disclaimer

All data was obtained through publicly available means or open datasets. Usage of data from proprietary platforms (e.g., PitchBook, S&P ESG) was limited to inferential parameter estimation and adheres to fair use principles under academic and non-commercial research exemptions.

   def pal(vi, vp, vf, sr, sk, ss, ct, vm):
       w = u = np.array([1/3, 1/3, 1/3])
       v = np.dot(w, [vi, vp, vf]) / np.sqrt(np.sum(w2) + ct2)
       s = np.dot(u, [sr, sk, ss]) / np.sqrt(np.sum(u2) + ct2)
       alpha, beta = 1.5, 0.5
       v_eff = v / (1 + alpha * s + ct)
       s_eff = s / (1 + beta * v + ct)
       f = v_eff - s_eff
       pt = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-f))
       tt = 12 * s_eff / v_eff
       sd = v_eff * vm
       return pt, tt, sd

     Load dataset
   data = pd.read_csv('pal_dataset.csv')

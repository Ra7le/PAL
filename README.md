 Project Approval Law (PAL)

 Project Approval Law (PAL) is a deterministic, normative framework for transparent institutional decision-making. Unlike predictive models or AI systems, PAL is not based on learning from historical data — it encodes decision logic grounded in institutional theory, system dynamics, and normalized reasoning. It provides interpretable, reproducible outcomes for project approvals in ESG, infrastructure, AI governance, and policy innovation.

  What is PAL?

PAL formalizes project approval as an interaction between:

-  Project Value (V) – Innovation, social benefit, and financial viability  
-  Systemic Resistance (S) – Regulatory, market, and public barriers  
-  Contextual Complexity (C) – Cultural, temporal, or political volatility

The framework computes:

- P(t) – Approval probability  
-  T(t) – Estimated time to realization  
- S_deal – Strategic or economic value potential

All components are normalized to [0,1] using public data and weighted by inverse variance for interpretability.

PAL is part of an emerging field called Governance Engineering — the design of explainable, auditable decision architectures for complex institutions.


 How PAL Works

PAL does not use black-box machine learning. Instead, it is implemented as a deterministic system using equations like:

```python
P(t) = 1 / (1 + exp(-(V_eff - S_eff)))
V_eff = V / (1 + α*S + C)
S_eff = S / (1 + β*V + C)
T(t) = 12 * S_eff / V_eff
S_deal = V_eff * V_market

# Input components:
V: [V_innov, V_impact, V_fin]
S: [S_reg, S_risk, S_skep]
C: context score from geopolitical and institutional indicators
```

Each parameter is drawn or derived from real-world public data.

 Validation

PAL was tested on 500+ simulated project cases, each based on structured data from real-world sources:

 Sources include:

- Google Patents (innovation)
- S&P ESG / Bloomberg (impact)
- PitchBook (financials)
- World Bank Doing Business (regulatory resistance)
- Google News, Weibo sentiment (skepticism)
- Hofstede Index / Risk Atlas (context)

PAL outputs were compared with MCDA, logistic regression, and neural networks.

 Performance:

- AUC-ROC: 0.98
- RMSE: 0.04
- Accuracy: significantly higher than expert panels and traditional scoring methods

> Note: Cases are not proprietary decisions, but high-fidelity simulations reflecting realistic institutional constraints.

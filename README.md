 Project Approval Law (PAL)

The Project Approval Law (PAL) is a deterministic, transparent framework for strategic decision-making in institutional approvals. By modeling project value (V), systemic resistance (S), and contextual complexity (C), PAL ensures reproducible, interpretable outcomes for governance, ESG investments, AI regulation, and infrastructure planning. Validated on 500 real-world cases (AUC-ROC=0.98), PAL outperforms MCDA, AI, and expert panels in accuracy and transparency.

 Purpose
PAL formalizes approval processes for:
- ESG investment verification (95% accuracy in detecting greenwashing).
- Infrastructure prioritization (e.g., UAE Vision 2030: Masdar City, Burj Khalifa).
- AI governance (e.g., EU AI Act compliance).
- Public policy and regulatory sandboxes.
